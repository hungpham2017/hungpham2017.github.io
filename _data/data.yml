    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am a quantum and materials chemist by training. My research interests include, but not limited to,
      quantum chemistry and molecular modeling of unconventional materials. I am also interested in expanding 
      my research to the field of data-driven science. I humbly believe that the advances in computer simulations 
      of science would change the way we live in the next few decades.
