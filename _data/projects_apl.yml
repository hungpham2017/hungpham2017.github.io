    Design novel lead-free perovskite for light harvesting
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Lead halide perovskites have been shown to have a great potential as an alternative to popular semiconductor like crystalline sillicon
    due to its chemical diversity and low processing cost. The primary problem is the environmental and human health concern relating to lead.
    Our main goal is to apply first principle calculations to design new lead-free perovskites with outstanding optoelectronic performaces.
