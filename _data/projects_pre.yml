    Bandgap engineering in MOFs
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The chemical and structural diversity of MOFs are explored to tune their electronic properties.
    This project was my undergraduate thesis topic and earned me my first paper on JPCC. 
    I learned a lot from this project from how to apply periodic DFT to study electronic structures of solid-state materials to the chemistry of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). 
    Working with a great team of MOFs chemists allowed me to expand my knowledge in the field of gas adsorption, crystallography, and porous materials.

    In silico design and topology analysis for MOFs
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Structure modeling and reticular chemistry are employed to design new MOFs structures for carbon capture and gas storage.
    At the beginning, the scope of this project was to design and synthesize new MOFs structures with exceptional surface areas and large pore size from hexagonal linkers.
    From my modeling, two outstanding structures were proposed, i.e. hxg- and she-MOFs. After exhausted efforts, my experimentalist colleagues could not turn them into real materials.
    Instead, four new beautiful structures were discovered, i.e. MOF-888,-889,-890,-891. My role was analyzing the crystal topology for these new crystals. This work earned me a paper in
    Inorganic Chemistry.
    Interestly, two years later after I already started my Ph.D. at Minnesota hxg-MOFs (by Eddaudi) and she-MOFs (by Zhang, Farha, and Snurr) were actually synthesized!
