    Bandgap engineering in MOFs
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The chemical and structural diversity of MOFs was explored to tune their electronic properties
    This project was my undergraduate thesis topic and earned me my first paper on JPCC. 
    I learned a lot from this project from the application of DFT to solid-state materials to the structure modeling of framework materials like MOFs, COFs, and ZIFs.

    In silico design and topology analysis for MOFs
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Structure modeling and reticular chemistry were employed to design new MOFs structures for carbon capture and gas storage
    I started this project with the scope to design and synthesize new MOFs structures with exceptional surface areas and pore size from hexagonal linkers.
    From my calculations, two outstanding structures were proposed, i.e. hxg- and she-MOFs. After exhausted efforts, my experimentalists could not turn them into real materials.
    Instead, four other new structures were synthesized, i.e. MOF-888,-889,-890,-891. I was analysizing the topology for these new structures and earn my second paper in Inorganic Chemistry. 
    Interestly, two years later after I already started my Ph.D. at Minnesota hxg- (Eddaudi) and she-MOFs (Zhang, Farha, and Snurr) were actually synthesized!
