    I am developing and applying electronic structure theories for periodic systems. 
    One of my development projects is the extension of density matrix embedding theory (DMET) to solid-state materials.
    The goal of this project is to make the correlated wavefunction method available for periodic systems, particularly for strongly correlated solids. 
    I have also been applying periodic density functional theory (DFT) to study condensed matters like perovskites
    for light harvesting, high performace electronics, and quantum computing.

    I was applying periodic density functional theory (DFT) to study electronic structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). 
    In addition, I was employing reticular chenistry, structure modeling, and GCMC simulation to design novel framework materials like MOFs, COFs, ZIFs for gas storage and carbon capture.
