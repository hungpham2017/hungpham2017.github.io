<h4>What is DMET?</h4>
<p>
Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) is a wave function-in-wave function embedding technique that allows one to treat extended systems
at the cost that is proportional to the size of a small fragment.

<h4>DMET with multireference solvers</h4>

        <p>
        We have explored the use of completely actice space self-consistent field (CASSCF) solver in conjunction with DMET[1]. An active space is introduced inside different fragments, i.e., 
        an DMET active space. The motivation is to limit the number of configurations of the impurity problem 
        and avoid using the full configuration interaction (FCI) solver which is unaffordable for most of chemical systems.

<h4>DMET for solid-state materials</h4>
<p>
DMET algorithm can be extended to periodic systems by using the Wannier functions.
<a href="https://github.com/hungpham2017/pDMET">pDMET</a> is a Python code to perform DMET calculation for solids.
One can obtain both ground-state energy and band structures. Future direction would be extending the algorithm 
to treat excitation and other type of interacting particles.
