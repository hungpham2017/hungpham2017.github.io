<h4>Why perovskite?</h4>
<p>
Metal halide perovskites with the general formula ABX<sub>3</sub> (A and B are metals, X is a halogen) have been emerged as promising solar-cell materials for 
the post-silicon era. Since the first work on the lead halide perovskites-based (MAPbI3) solar cell in 2009, more than one thousand of publication on this topic have been reported. 
Currently, the record-high power conversion efficiency of 23.3% is comparable to that of crystalline silicon making perovskites a promising 
alternative to silicon for semiconducting technology. 
<br> One big major problem of lead halide perovskites is the negative impact on the environment owing to its chemical instability. 
Seeking for non-toxic halide perovskite have been one of the hottest topics in materials science and semiconducting chemistry.

        <p>
        We have investigating the electronic structures of a series of In-based halide double perovskites for solar harvesting applications.
        Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 are two outstanding compounds in terms of electronic, transporting, and optical properties. More details can 
        be found in our recent paper [1].
