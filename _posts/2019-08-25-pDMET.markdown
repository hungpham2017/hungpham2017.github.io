**What is DMET?**
<p>
Density matrix embedding theory is a wave function-in-wave function embedding technique that allows one to treat extended systems
at the cost that is proportional to the size of a small fragment.

**DMET for solid-state materials**
<p>
DMET algorithm can be extended to periodic systems by using the Wannier functions.
<a href="https://github.com/hungpham2017/pDMET">pDMET</a> is a Python code to perform DMET calculation for solids.
One can obtain both ground-state energy and band structures. Future direction would be extending the algorithm 
to treat excitation and other type of interacting particles.
