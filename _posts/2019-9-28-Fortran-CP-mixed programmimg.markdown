## Summary:

A question is popping up in your head: **why would I even want to do this?** 
Well, a lot of well-established programs written by chemists are in F90 (even in F77!!!).
Unless you want to rewrite them in C/C++ or Python (*possible but maybe that's the only code you write for a few years*), you may wish there is a way to call them from a C/C++ or python program.
I decided to write this post because I faced the same problem while attempting to do this. So I hope someone out there may find my tips useful.
