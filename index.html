    Hello, my name's Hung and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the department of chemistry, University of Minnesota.
    My research includes the development of new electronic structure theories for periodic systems as well as the application of current techniques
    (e.g. DFT, GW) to the field of materials science and condensed matters.
