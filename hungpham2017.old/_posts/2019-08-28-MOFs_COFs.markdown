<h3>MOFs and COFs</h3>
<p>
For the last two decades, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been an attractive class of materials 
with variety of applications, such as gas storage, carbon capture, catalysis, and electronic devides.
Their successes have been attributed to their structural and chemical diversity. By combining building units (e.g., 
metal oxide clusters and organic ligands) with different geometries and functional groups, thousands of structures 
can be made for a certain application.
<br>In a similar manner, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are also crystalline framework materials,
however, COFs are composed of purely organic building units.

The story behind the success of MOFs can be found in this excellent lecture by Omar Yaghi:

        The chemical diversity of MOFs can be used to tune their electronic structure, in particular, their band gaps.
        In out work [1], we have explored the possibility of tuning the band gaps in series of isoreticular MOFs based on IRMOF-20.
        We have found that a semiconducting band gap in MOFs can be possibly obtained via this approach. 
        Importantly, the bulk gaps are mainly determined by the organic linker rather than the ZnO<sub>4</sub> cluster.
        This implys that one can obtain useful information of the bulk gap by only inspecting the electronic structure of linkers.

<h3>Charge transport in COFs</h3>

        <p>
        Single-layer two-dimensional COFs are attractive for electronic devides. However, their application have been prohibited due to 
        the electronic localization of the linkages. In our work [4], we have investigated this localization for some common linkages 
        of COFs chemistry. Next, we have analyzed the electronic delocalization in CS-COFs and phthalocyanine-based COFs (PcCOFs). We further 
        compute the charge mobility for a series of PcCOFs with different numbers of benzene units between Pc. We found that these materials 
        exhibit exceptionally high mobilities which are comparable with other 2D materials like MoS<sub>2</sub> and graphene. 
        The attractive transport properties together with their thermodynamic and mechanical stability make these materials if realized promising 
        for semiconducting applications.
